# sar_backprojection

This project is a GPU implementation of a sar backprojection (https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5059&context=etd) algorithm. This algorithm takes inputs a block of data generated by radar returns from an airplane in flight, and transforms the radar pulse data into a viewable image (for examples, see images here: https://www.sandia.gov/radar/imagery/index.html#modes1).

In its current state (as of 4/24/2019) the important parts of this repo are the sar_bp.cu file that contains the main sar backprojection function (still a work in progress) and two device helper functions (completed and tested), and unit_tests.cu which kicks off a unit test for one of the helper functions. 

The main focus of this codebase is performance and speed. Shared memory buffers are reused whenever possible, as few operations as possible are used, and floats are used instead of doubles (eventually everything will be templated for both).
